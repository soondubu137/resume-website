# About Me

R√©sum√©: 

::: details Background
I used to study mathematics and physics, and I was quite good at them. While I was further pursuing mathematics (algebraic topology), however, I realized that math is for the *truly* brilliant people, of which I am sadly not one. Eventually, I made the decision to switch career.

Graduated from UC Berkeley, I knew how popular the CS61 trilogy is. I gave CS61A a try (available online), and I finished the whole course within two weeks. Taking CS61A was a completely different experience from all the math classes I had been taking. Working with not-so-abstract concepts is actually a lot of fun (I had always enjoyed the abstractness of math).

After finishing CS61A, I took CS61B. After finishing CS61B, I took CS61C and CS188... Putting my knowledge to test, I enrolled in CIS537 at UPenn - graduate-level medical image analysis. At the end of the semester, I was one of only a few students to receive an A+ in the course. Then, I joined a bioinformatics research lab at the school of medicine.

I am currently studying computer science at the University of Chicago. I will graduate in December 2024. I worked as a SWE intern at a startup company during the summer, and I am currently looking for full-time SWE job opportunities.
