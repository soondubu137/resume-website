# Related Courses

A list of the related courses I have taken, officially and unofficially. Physics courses are not counted as related.

::: info NOTE
An `unofficial` course is a course that I did not enroll in. Instead, I self-studied the course
through the materials that the university generously made available online. For a course to be listed as `unofficial`, I must have finished the entire course, including lectures, homework, labs, and projects.
